Flight Data Management System for Airline

This project aims to develop a flight data management system for an airline. The system will manage data related to airports, flights, and airline information. The system includes entities such as Airport and Flight, along with an Airport Manager to keep track of airports.

The system features various functions such as isSameAirport, isAirportName, addAirport, findAirportByName, isFlightFromSourceName, isFlightToDestName, isPlaneCodeInFlight, isPlaneTypeInFlight, addFlight, doPrintFlightsWithPlaneCode, doPrintFlightsWithPlaneType, and doCountFlightsFromName. These functions allow for efficient management of flight data, including flight details, aircraft types, and airport information.

The airline entity will store the company name, number of flights, and an array of flights. Additional functions may be required to further optimize the system.

Overall, the flight data management system is designed to streamline flight operations, improve data accuracy, and enhance customer experience.
